## About the Project:

UniversityEmployed is a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) solution developed as part of the COMS W4152 Engineering Software-as-a-Service course. We aim to bridge the gap between academia and research by creating a centralized platform tailored for the Columbia University community.

## Key Pain Points Addressed:

- Facilitating PhD students and professors in posting project/research ideas.  
  Many Ph.D. students and professors have project ideas but struggle to find a platform where they can seek help from undergraduate or graduate students.
- Overcoming the lack of a centralized and regularly updated platform for research opportunities.  
  While there are numerous resources for students to find research opportunities, there is no single platform where they can explore all of them. Additionally, many of these  websites suffer from outdated information. Often, positions get filled, but the posts remain active, leading to confusion and wasted effort for students who apply or try to contact professors for PhD students, believing the opportunity is still available.
- Eliminating communication barriers between students and professors.  
  Emailing professors can be daunting for students, and it often leads to unanswered emails, creating discouragement and missed opportunities.

## Key Features:

- Professors can seamlessly add, edit, or remove research opportunities.  
  Professors will be able to add/edit/remove their projects and research positions on this platform. They will not have to worry about recruiting students interested in research by reaching out to them in various ways. emails, posting to various platforms 
- Students can view, filter, and apply for research positions in real-time.  
  On this webpage, students will be able to see all available projects and opportunities. They will be able to filter the positions based on their academic and personal interests. This makes it so that the student does not have to go to many different sites and email different teachers to find job opportunities. 
- Integrated communication tool, ensuring timely and organized interactions between parties.  
  This web page will provide an effective communication link between students looking for research positions and professors looking for workers, which would make the job-finding process better for students and Professors.
- Centralized database aggregating research roles from all Columbia colleges.

## What Sets Us Apart?

UniversityEmployeed offers a distinctive and innovative solution to a prevalent challenge facing Columbia University students, setting us apart from existing options in the market. Unlike the current landscape, which lacks a real-time updatable database for students to discover and post research opportunities, our platform goes beyond addressing this issue. While there are school-specific platforms like UNLEASH ( at the University of Virginia, which enables professors to post research opportunities and allows undergraduates to submit email applications, our solution for Columbia University is unique in several ways. Firstly, we extend the scope of our platform beyond undergraduates, catering to the diverse academic community at Columbia, including PhD students. This inclusivity is a key differentiator, ensuring that all members of the university can leverage our platform to connect with research opportunities. Secondly, we enhance the user experience by implementing a built-in communication platform that eliminates the hassle of managing emails. This feature streamlines the interaction between students and professors, making the process more efficient and user-friendly. Moreover, we differentiate ourselves by aggregating research opportunities from all colleges within Columbia, offering a centralized and comprehensive database. This functionality simplifies the search process, enabling students to explore a wider range of opportunities with convenience.
